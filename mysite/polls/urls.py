"""mysite URL Configuration

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))
"""
from django.urls import path
from . import views


urlpatterns = [
    #sets the home path to views.index which refers to the index view
    #ex: /polls/
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    # ex: /polls/5/
    path('<int:question_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),
    # ex: /polls/5/results/ uses a question id number in the url
    path('<int:question_id>/results/', views.results, name='results'),
    # ex: /polls/5/vote/
    path('<int:question_id>/vote/', views.vote, name='vote'),
]

"""
path() takes 2 required arguments and 2 optional arguments
route: the string that contains a url pattern
view: calls this specified views function with an HttpRequest object as the first object
kwargs: arbitrary keyword arguments can be passed in a dictionary to the target view.
name: naming the URL lets you refer to it unambiguously from elsewhere in Django. This is useful for templates.
